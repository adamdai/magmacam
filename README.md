This repo contains applications and demos for embedded FPGA systems developed
using the [magma HDL](https://github.com/phanrahan/magma).

Here is a breakdown of the various directories.

## IceStick
This directory contains Magma programs written for the Lattice ICE40 IceStick
architecture.

### arducam.py
A magma module which exposes the SPI interface of an ArduCAM Mini 2MP 
peripheral for initiating a capture and receiving image data

### process.py
A magma module which processes RGB
pixel data converting it to grayscale values

### pipeline.py
BNN digit classifier adapted from https://github.com/MIT-HAN-LAB/BNN_IceStick.
Instead of the loading the image into ROM at initialization time, the circuit
has a RAM for storing image bits so that the input of the BNN may be wired to
another circuit (e.g. the output of the ArduCAM).

### main.py
The main program which defines a top level module (`main`).  It uses the
ArduCAM circuit (defined in `arducam.py`), which exposes the SPI interface of
an ArduCAM Mini 2MP peripheral for initiating a capture and receiving image
data, and the Process circuit (defined in `process.py`), which processes RGB
pixel data converting it to grayscale values.


**TODO:** It would be good to document how to run these tests (using the logic
analyzer?) Also, maybe these should be moved to a `tests` directory. We could
also consider writing some tests for these using the Python or CoreIR
simulator, so we could run them on Travis.
### stencil.py
Test program for the STEN aetherling module (see below).

### downscale_test.py
Test program to downscale a 320x240 ArduCAM image to a 16x16 using the
Downscale aetherling module. Currently too large to run on the IceStick.

### RAM_test.py
Test program which feeds an image stored in ROM to the RAM in the `pipeline.py`
circuit and runs the BNN classifier.

## aetherling
This folder contains high level magma circuits defined using the [aetherling
library](https://github.com/David-Durst/aetherling). It contains the STEN
module (in `test_linebuffer.py`) which downscales a 4x4 image to a 2x2 using a
window size of 2x2 and summing over the pixel values in each window to obtain
each new output pixel value, 
(**TODO:** Should this average the pixels? Are they grayscale?)
and the Downscale module (in`downscale.py`) which
is designed to downscale a 320x240 image (taken by the ArduCAM) to a 16x16 (to
feed into the BNN classifier) using a window size of 20x15. 

## util
This folder contains some miscellaneous python scripts. `bmp2png.py` creates a
png image from a csv file of 16-bit RGB pixel values (as bytes),
`bytes2jpeg.py` creates a jpg image from a a csv of raw JPEG bytes, and
`gray2img.py` displays a grayscale image from a csv file of grayscale values.
`monitor.py` is a simple program to receive UART data from the IceStick.
(**TODO:** Would be good to note what these are used for, such as example use
case. E.g. the bmp2png can be used with the logic analyzer)
